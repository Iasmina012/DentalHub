Experts recommend visiting the dentist at least once every six months for a routine examination and cleaning. During the visit, your dentist will check for cavities, gum disease, and other oral health issues. They will also provide professional cleaning to remove plaque and tartar buildup. If you experience pain, sensitivity, or other changes in your oral health, schedule an appointment immediately.

Start by choosing a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Hold your brush at a 45-degree angle to your gums and use gentle circular motions to clean each tooth thoroughly. Brush for at least two minutes, covering all surfaces: the outside, inside, and chewing areas of each tooth. Donâ€™t forget to brush your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath. For optimal dental health, brush your teeth twice a day, in the morning and before bedtime.", R.drawable.brushing);

Hold the floss tightly between your thumbs and index fingers and gently slide it up and down between your teeth. Curve the floss around the base of each tooth, making sure you go beneath the gumline. Never snap or force the floss, as this may cut or bruise delicate gum tissue. Use clean sections of floss as you move from tooth to tooth.", R.drawable.flossing);

Spit out the mouthwash; do not swallow it. For best results, avoid eating or drinking for 30 minutes after using mouthwash so the active ingredients can work effectively.\n" + "\n", R.drawable.rinsing);
